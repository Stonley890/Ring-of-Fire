Ring of Fire is a simple asymmetrical multiplayer Minecraft minigame for a variable number of players.

## Gameplay

One player plays as the hunter and all other players play as survivors. The game can be played anywhere but is confined to a 256x256 area via the world border. At the start of the game, survivors are teleported randomly throughout the play area. All players are given invisibility for five minutes. During these five minutes, the Hunter must place five given obsidian within the play area. These obsidian blocks must be placed at least 32 blocks apart from each other and will glow once placed. Any obsidian blocks not placed during the five-minute prep period will be removed and only the obsidian blocks placed will be in play. The survivors may prepare in any way they choose during the five minutes of invisibility.

After the five-minute prep period is over, all players will become visible. The hunter has a faster movement speed and is completely invulnerable. The hunter may be attacked by the survivors and inflict knockback, but the hunter will never lose health. In addition, the hunter is given a compass that will track the nearest survivor when held in the main hand.

Survivors have three lives each. After a survivor loses their last life, they will respawn in spectator mode.

Obsidian blocks glow for all players, but Minecraft limits the range that this glow can be seen. The default is 64 blocks, but this may vary depending on your server/game settings.

The game ends when all survivors have lost their lives or when all obsidian has been destroyed.

## Setup

Make sure the data pack is loaded and run `/reload` (or `/minecraft:reload` when using Bukkit/Spigot/Paper) to ensure the pack is initialized. Use `/team join Runner [player]` to add players to the survivor team. Use `/team join Hunter [player]` to add a player to the hunter team. **The game is not intended for multiple hunters. You can have multiple hunters, but the balancing is not designed for such configuration.** When you are ready, have one player run `/function rof:start` in the center of your play area to start the game.

If you want to start another game in the same world, you must destroy all glowing obsidian before doing so.

**This game will not function correctly if the difficulty is set to peaceful.**
